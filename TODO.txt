- ✓ Add test for ser/deser Log Messages
- Enhance the NativeHandler example in README.md to include a simple
  filtering demonstration
- ✓ The report.md mentions that the handler "removes entries from the
  cache upon receiving a subscription failure notification." This is
  critical for preventing memory leaks in the reference map. However,
  this behavior is not explicitly documented for the user in README.md.
  Can you please add a small section or a note in the README.md, likely
  under "Managed Context" or "Observer Functions", that highlights this
  responsibility?
- Measure if this new change affected performance
- Installation in the TT server
- Update the diagram
- Last question:  is this repo a fork of the old one with new changes
  yeah? https://github.com/lechiffre/bloomberg-macro-connector
- ✓ Test for ReferenceMap
- Example of filtering
- prior value
